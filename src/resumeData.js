  aboutme:
    "My name is Aaron Perry, and I have recently graduated from Ulster University in July 2019. I am actively in search of a graduate opportunity within Software/Web Development. I am passionate and ambitious, and I love making applications look good! In particular, using front-end technologies such as jQuery and React make this possible. In my spare time, I am also learning back end tech, in order to become a Full Stack Developer. Outside of web design, I like to practice other software development languages, such as Java and C++.",

      YearOfPassing: "2019",
      Achievements:
        "During my time at Ulster University, I have become profoundly efficient with development languages such as JavaScript, C++, C#, HTML, Java and SQL. During my time at University I have practiced these languages by creating things like websites and databases for various assignments and even learning the code for written exams. Throughout my final year at University I have become extremely efficient using PHP, as this is the language I used to complete my Final Year Project. I have also more recently become a lot more familiar with HTML and JavaScript whilst studying Dynamic Web Authoring as we are required to build a website and use frameworks such as Bootstrap 4."

        "Whilst I attended NRC, I covered the basic fundamentals of computer programming. This course ranged from modules such as database design, to video game design. One of the main pieces of software I used at NRC was Microsoft Visual Studio. Upon completion of this course, it then allowed me to progress to Ulster University and obtain my degree."

      Achievements:
        "I would say that during my time working there, the most valuable thing I had learnt would be developing my teamwork skills when working as a team, as this was a key part of the job. Another important skill I have developed would also be my communication skills and this has helped me at University as I could effectively communicate with my group during our oral presentations preparation. Finally, during my time as a Staff Trainer working at McDonalds, I have now developed myself into a hard-working person who can achieve excellent results under pressure, in a high speed working environment."
